# Exploring Trends in Australian Census Data

## Aim

The aim of this assignment is to examine trends, or changes, in Australia's demographics from 1996 to 2021 using ABS Census data.

You may choose what census topic you are most interested in from the data, providing it is not one that we have addressed in the lecture or lab case studies \(such as age, number of children, or travel to work\). For best results, you should also choose a topic with multiple categories \(not, for example, binary categories\). You may focus on particular categories of interest.

## Packages

The following packages, _only_, may be imported and used in this project:

Compulsory

* matplotlib/pyplot

Optional \(only for those who wish to use them, there are no marks attached to use of these\)

* csv
* numpy
* seaborn
* re
  
### Run the following to try the notebook:
```sh
$ pipenv run jupyter notebook ./Australian_Trends.ipynb
```
